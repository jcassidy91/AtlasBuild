Berries "pop" when hit by an attack or when bumped into while riding your broom.

- **Bounce Berries** force Atlas to jump even if she's in mid air- does not count as double jumping
- **Woosh Berries** force Atlas on her broom even if she's already used it. This does count as using your broom.
- **Bomb Berries** can blow up rocks and are affected by other berries:
   - Bombs bounce off bounce berries.
   - Bombs are given wings and will fly forward on collision with woosh berries.
   - Bomb berries can be picked by the player when collided against while on broom. Berries can be dropped by canceling the broom.
