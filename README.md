# Instructions:

This demo contains two sections:
First, walk to the gardens. The room before the gardens contains three challenge doors, only the middle door is something I would call "well designed". I reccommend you skip this section entirely and come back after completing the gardens.

Second, collect the star at the top of the gardens. You'll need to rejuvenate two different berry types by restoring the water flow to each of their trees hidden in the gardens.

# Berries:
Berries "pop" when hit by an attack or when bumped into while riding your broom.

| Berry Type | Color | Effect when popped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bounce Berry | Green | Forces Atlas to jump even if she's in mid air- does not count as double jumping |
| Woosh Berry | Red | Forces Atlas on her broom even if she's already used it. Works even if Broom has already been used |
| Bomb Berries | Blue | Can blow up rocks and are affected by other berries:<br />   - Bombs bounce off bounce berries.<br />   - Bombs are given wings and will fly forward on collision with woosh berries.<br />   - Bomb berries can be picked by the player when collided against while on broom. Berries can be dropped by canceling the broom |
